extent to which one feels boundaries fall away between\noneself and the surrounding environment. This dimension can\nbe demonstrated by a commonly used measure to assess the\ndegree to which an individual feels connected to other people or\none’s environment (Aron, Aron, & Smollan, 1992; see Figure\n1).\nSelf-transcendence has been variously conceptualized in the\npsychological literature in ways that arenotrelevant to our defi-\nnition. Erickson (1982) described self-transcendence as anon-ego-\ncentric understandingof the world. Although our conception of\nSTE may involve a decreasingly ego-centric spatial frame of\nreference, it does not assume that there is a change in one’s\nconceptual understanding of a self-centered perspective on the\nworld. Frankl (1966) referred to self-transcendence as aprioriti-\nzation of other peopleover self-focus.

existence in general. Although such prosocial attitudes and\nmotivations may result from an STE, they are not part of the\ntransient state of STE we describe here. Other approaches describe\nself-transcendence as apersonality factor(Piedmont, 1999), or a\ndevelopmental processinvolving a maturing capacity for mean-\ningful connection (Levenson, Jennings, Aldwin, & Shiraishi, 2005;\nTornstam, 2005). A few approaches describe long-term alterations\nto self-processes calledselflessness(Dambrun & Ricard, 2011;\nDavis & Vago, 2013), whereas here we focus on brief mental\nstates. The self-transcendence subscale of the Temperament and\nCharacter Inventory (TCI; Cloninger, Svrakic, & Przybeck, 1993)\noperationalizes self-transcendence as a trait-like tendency to both\nbelieveandfeelthat one is part of, rather than apart from, the\nuniverse as a whole (Garcia-Romeu, 2010).

Rather, it means being willing to step outside of our familiar routines and ways of thinking, and to challenge ourselves in healthy and sustainable ways.\\n\\nMaintaining sensitivity to discomfort helps keep us grounded and aware of our own needs and boundaries, and can help us grow and transcend in a way that is both meaningful and sustainable."},{"role":"user","content":"It's certainly helpful in many ways to have a healthy body, but traditionally seekers of mystical experience are often said to have almost tortured themselves in order to force themselves to let go of ordinary concerns in order to experience a higher reality, I guess, right?  "},{"role":"assistant","content":"There are indeed many examples throughout history of spiritual seekers using forms of austerity or asceticism, such as fasting, silence, or physical self-mortification, in order to transcend ordinary concerns and experience a higher reality. These practices have been used in different religious and spiritual traditions around the world, from Christianity to Hinduism to Buddhism.\\n\\nThe goal of these practices has been to strip away the distractions and attachments of the physical world, in order to open oneself up to the divine or the transcendent. However, it's worth noting that these practices can be dangerous and even harmful if taken to extremes, and they are not necessary for everyone seeking mystical experiences. \\n\\nMany spiritual seekers have found that a balanced approach, one that honors the body and mind while also cultivating mindfulness and an openness to experience, can be just as effective in achieving transcendent states. Ultimately, the path of transcendence is a personal one, and each individual must find their own way that honors their own unique needs and limitations."},{"role":"user","content":"Is self-transcendence a spiritual experience?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Self-transcendence can certainly be a spiritual experience, but it is not limited to spiritual or religious contexts. Self-transcendence can be understood as an expansion of one's sense of self, often through experiences that challenge one's existing beliefs, values, or sense of identity. This can happen both within and outside of specific spiritual or religious traditions.\\n\\nWhile self-transcendence can certainly involve experiences that are associated with spiritual or transcendental realms, such as experiences of unity, transcendence, or non-duality, it can also be experienced in more mundane contexts. For example, learning a new skill, overcoming a fear, or connecting with others in a deep and meaningful way can all lead to an expansion of one's sense of self and an experience of self-transcendence.\\n\\nUltimately, self-transcendence is a subjective experience that can take many forms, depending on the individual's context, beliefs, and personal goals. It can involve the spiritual, the psychological, the social, or the creative, to name a few possibilities. The important thing is to remain open and curious to the possibilities of personal growth and self-transcendence, and to remain true to one's own values and experiences along the way."},{"role":"user","content":"Is there a difference between self-transcendence and personal growth that's analogous to the difference between evolution and revolution in scientific theory, as per Kuhn?"}]}`,

Don't be discouraged if you find some aspects more challenging than others – progress is often slow and requires patience and perseverance."},{"role":"user","content":"It seems hard to try to do everything at once, yet it all seems intricately interconnected."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You are correct in noting that the different ways to transcend oneself are interconnected and can reinforce each other. For example, practicing empathy can lead to greater self-awareness, which can in turn help identify areas for personal growth. Similarly, developing a growth mindset can help you take more risks and embrace discomfort, which can lead to new forms of creativity and self-expression.\\n\\nIt's important to note that you don't need to try to do everything at once or to be perfect in every area. Rather, focus on the areas that resonate with you the most and that you feel are most important for your own growth and development. This may involve setting goals in those areas and working on them one step at a time. \\n\\nRemember, the journey of self-transcendence is a lifelong process, and small steps taken consistently can lead to significant progress over time. Don't be too hard on yourself if you face setbacks or challenges along the way, and celebrate your successes as they come."},{"role":"user","content":"While embracing discomfort I guess it's important to not shut down our sensitivity to discomfort, right, or else it seems like machismo."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, it's important to not shut down our sensitivity to discomfort when embracing discomfort as a means to transcend oneself. While it's important to challenge ourselves and step out of our comfort zones, it's equally important to be aware of our limits and to listen to our bodies and minds when they tell us we need a break or a change of pace.\\n\\nEmbracing discomfort doesn't mean we need to engage in extreme physical or mental challenges that can harm us or put us in danger, or to ignore our own feelings and emotions. Rather, it means being willing to step outside of our familiar routines and ways of thinking, and to challenge ourselves in healthy and sustainable ways.\\n\\nMaintaining sensitivity to discomfort helps keep us grounded and aware of our own needs and boundaries, and can help us grow and transcend in a way that is both meaningful and sustainable."},{"role":"user","content":"It's certainly helpful in many ways to have a healthy body, but traditionally seekers of mystical experience are often said to have almost tortured themselves in order to force themselves to let go of ordinary concerns in order to experience a higher reality, I guess, right?  "},{"role":"assistant","content":"There are indeed many examples throughout history of spiritual seekers using forms of austerity or asceticism, such as fasting, silence, or physical self-mortification, in order to transcend ordinary concerns and experience a higher reality. These practices have been used in different religious and spiritual traditions around the world, from Christianity to Hinduism to Buddhism.\\n\\nThe goal of these practices has been to strip away the distractions and attachments of the physical world, in order to open oneself up to the divine or the transcendent. However, it's worth noting that these practices can be dangerous and even harmful if taken to extremes, and they are not necessary for everyone seeking mystical experiences. \\n\\nMany spiritual seekers have found that a balanced approach, one that honors the body and mind while also cultivating mindfulness and an openness to experience, can be just as effective in achieving transcendent states. Ultimately, the path of transcendence is a personal one, and each individual must find their own way that honors their own unique needs and limitations."},{"role":"user","content":"Is self-transcendence a spiritual experience?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Self-transcendence can certainly be a spiritual experience, but it is not limited to spiritual or religious contexts. Self-transcendence can be understood as an expansion of one's sense of self, often through experiences that challenge one's existing beliefs, values, or sense of identity. This can happen both within and outside of specific spiritual or religious traditions.\\n\\nWhile self-transcendence can certainly involve experiences that are associated with spiritual or transcendental realms, such as experiences of unity, transcendence, or non-duality, it can also be experienced in more mundane contexts. For example, learning a new skill, overcoming a fear, or connecting with others in a deep and meaningful way can all lead to an expansion of one's sense of self and an experience of self-transcendence.\\n\\nUltimately, self-transcendence is a subjective experience that can take many forms, depending on the individual's context, beliefs, and personal goals. It can involve the spiritual, the psychological, the social, or the creative, to name a few possibilities. The important thing is to remain open and curious to the possibilities of personal growth and self-transcendence, and to remain true to one's own values and experiences along the way."},{"role":"user","content":"Is there a difference between self-transcendence and personal growth that's analogous to the difference between evolution and revolution in scientific theory, as per Kuhn?"}]}`,

  Self-transcendence has been variously conceptualized in the

  STE may involve a decreasingly ego-centric spatial frame of
  reference, it does not assume that there is a change in one’s
  conceptual understanding of a self-centered perspective on the
  world. Frankl (1966) referred to self-transcendence as aprioriti-

  developmental processinvolving a maturing capacity for mean-
  ingful connection (Levenson, Jennings, Aldwin, & Shiraishi, 2005;
  Tornstam, 2005). A few approaches describe long-term alterations
  to self-processes calledselflessness(Dambrun & Ricard, 2011;
  Davis & Vago, 2013), whereas here we focus on brief mental
  states. The self-transcendence subscale of the Temperament and
  Character Inventory (TCI; Cloninger, Svrakic, & Przybeck, 1993)
  operationalizes self-transcendence as a trait-like tendency to both
  believeandfeelthat one is part of, rather than apart from, the
